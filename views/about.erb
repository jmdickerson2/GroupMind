    <div class="margin">
      <p class="lead">I decided to make GroupMind for a web development course that I'm currently taking called 
        Bloc. Part of the course involves building your own web app with Ruby on Rails. Because I have a passion for 
        learning and teaching others, this app seemed like the perfect fit!</p>
